Our wedding will take place in a stunning garden in San Antonio, promising a lively celebration filled with color, creativity, whimsy, and romance.

We want you to feel glamorous while celebrating with us. Imagine yourself stepping into a modern-day hacienda adorned with disco balls, lanterns, bright florals, and eclectic dance music. The dress code is cocktail formal with colors and textures that radiate fun and your individual style.

> We encourage bold, vibrant colors and bright jewel tones to capture the magic of the evening.

Feathers and velvet are most certainly welcomed to enhance the festive, party vibe. Dress to impress and get ready to dance the night away in the Lone Star State! Looking for inspiration?
