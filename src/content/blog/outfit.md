> Our wedding in the stunning Taos High Desert of New Mexico is set to be a vibrant celebration of color, creativity, and whimsy.

We want you to feel glamorous while celebrating with us in the high
desert. Imagine yourself stepping into a modern-day '60s or '70s
disco, but the disco sits atop Outlaw Hill in Taos, NM. The dress code
is formal with colors and textures that radiate elegance and fun. We
encourage bold, vibrant colors and bright jewel tones to capture the
magic of the evening. Picture yourself in your favorite winter coat,
perhaps a fur gem thatâ€™s been tucked away in your closet. Feathers and
velvet are most certainly welcomed to enhance the festive, retro vibe.
Dress to impress and get ready to dance the night away under the
desert stars! Looking for inspiration?
