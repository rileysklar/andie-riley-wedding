When it came time to choose a wedding venue, we considered many possibilities—but San Antonio continued to call us home. In 1986, Riley’s parents eloped and exchanged vows in front of the statue of St. Anthony on the Paseo del Rio, then celebrated just steps away at Durty Nelly’s Irish Pub on the Riverwalk. It was St. Patrick’s Day—the river flowed green, the air was filled with celebration, and the city enveloped the beginning of their journey in joy.

To honor their love story, we followed in their footsteps. We chose Ivy Hall in San Antonio, near the Riverwalk on South St. Mary’s, during the vibrant festivities of Fiesta. In a beautiful full-circle moment, we gathered with friends and family for our rehearsal dinner after-party at the very same Irish pub—Durty Nelly’s—where it all began.
