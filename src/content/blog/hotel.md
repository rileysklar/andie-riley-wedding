If youâ€™re traveling with family or a large group, consider renting a vacation home. Beautiful adobe and southwestern-designed homes are available throughout the area. Star gazing will be spectacular! Some homes in the area are very remote. Please take into consideration the proximity to Taos city center as well as if 4WD is required.
