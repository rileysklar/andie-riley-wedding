  <p>
    The look in your eyes is sweet and compelling and i cant look away even if i
    tried and the glow of your skin is bright and its shining and i better be
    careful or it will make me go blind cause youre the most beautiful woman
    that i ever saw and we fell in love right under the stars out in the desert
    on a cold texas night, if i could hold you forever everything is alright
